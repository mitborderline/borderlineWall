 <p>Hihi~ My name is Yiming Chen, and I am a freshman living in China who's interested in 18C (Math+CS), 2 (Mechanical Engineering), and French! I'm involved with Borderline (as co-publicity chair<3), the UA, the MIT Chinese Music Ensemble, and the figure skating club (though I'm an absolute beginner lol). In my free time, I love drawing, painting, playing a traditional Chinese zither called Guzheng, eating fruit, and jogging at a local park while listening to audiobooks. I also love making new friends, so please give me a poke if you wanna chat~ :)</p>
