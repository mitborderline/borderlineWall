 <p>Hello! I'm Penny--I'm a '24 living in East Campus planning to major in 18-C & 8 (Mathematics & Computer Science + Physics)! In my free time, I like to play piano, paint, read & write fiction, and I've also been learning how to dance! I also really enjoy good food & making friends, so I'm always down to grab food and chat! :DD</p>
