 <p>Hello0oOo I'm Audrey Cui, a 2024 intending on studying 6-9 (computation & cognition)! I live in East Campus, a wonderful dorm that lets you paint your room. I moved into a dorm painted a loud shade of teal that I can only describe as radioactive snot green. Initially I wasn't a huge fan, but it's been kind of growing on me. So far I've painted cats and fluffy clouds on my walls, so my tunnel66 room is a fantasized version of my real room. In addition to getting frustrated over psets, I'm involved in Borderline (AR murals club), making art for MIT Admissions, THINK/TechX, and Bhangra. I run Big Dijkstra Energy, a math/cs pun webcomic, with my wonderful friends Gloria '21, Margaret '23, and Penny '24. I also UROP in CSAIL on transparent AI, which somehow involves manipulating images of sad dogs into happy dogs. Fun fact about me: I am blocked by a cult on Facebook. </p>
