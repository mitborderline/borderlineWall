 <p>Hello everyone! I'm Jessica Pan, a 2024 in Computer Science and Molecular Biology (6-7) with a minor in 4b (Art and Design). I'm originally from Chicago, but I'm currently living in McCormick 3E and am excited to meet everyone! I'm also a part of ESP (the educational studies program, which runs Spark, Splash, and other events you might have heard of!), Lean on Me, and a couple of other clubs. I look forward to meeting you all, in whatever form that takes :D </p>
