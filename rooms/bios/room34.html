 <p>Hey!! I'm Nina, a '24 and course 4 architecture major! I live in East Campus (4E), and I love to explore various realms of art when I'm really supposed to be working. I like to do archery and read novels when I have time; I am also a fan of cities, design, and fashion. Let me know if you have common interests and want a friend! :)</p>
