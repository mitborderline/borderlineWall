 <p>I'm Philena Liu, a current frosh ('24) living in MacGregor G Entry! I'm thinking of majoring in 18C (or maybe 18 or 6), and I'm involved in Borderline (as the co-pub chair woohoo <33) and HMMT. I bought a bunch of tapestry and pillows online (shown in the drawing), and I have super bad posture so I STRUGGLED to move the shelves around so that I could place my monitor higher up. Let's hope my neck doesn't hurt this semester *crosses fingers*. More about me: I like to play badminton (top right shelf!), draw, do css and struggle with css, whistle, watch kdramas/anime/webtoons, and listen to kpop in my free time ;))</p>
