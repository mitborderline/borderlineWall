	<p>Hello! I'm Emily. I'm a class of 2023 in 6-3 with a love for developing electric race cars (check out fsae.mit.edu)
		and helping to advance medicine and healthcare (UROPed for designing and developing medical device). Born in
		Chengdu, China, but now I'm calling San Francisco Bay Area my home. My room in tunnel 66 preserves a little bit of
		everything from different dorm rooms (because rona) I lived in since freshmen year (MacGregor, Maseeh, McCormick,
		and Simmons) and my home. Feel free to stalk me at <a href="https://yxshi.io/" target="yxs_">yxshi.io</a></p>
