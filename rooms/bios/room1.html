	<p>Hello I'm <a href="http://gzlin.mit.edu/" target="gl_">Gloria Lin</a>! I live in McCormick Hall, and I studied 6-3 Computer Science (working on MEng now). Though my
		dorm room isn't as verdant as this, it had a gorgeous view of the Charles River and Boston skyline, pictured here--
		can you spot Prudential Tower? This year, I moved rooms, so no river view, but my huge west-facing windows make for gorgeous sunsets!<br> 
		Outside of classes, I was President of Borderline last year (wrote this site lol) and have
		painted and animated a couple murals on campus. I'm also involved with Women in EECS, and I write and illustrate for
		The Tech (newspaper). Fun fact: this room was inspired by the LoFi radio study girl. </p></div>
