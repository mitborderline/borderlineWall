	<p>Hello, I'm <a href="http://gzlin.mit.edu/" target="gl_">Gloria</a>! I live in McCormick Hall, I studied 6-3
		Computer Science, and I'm currently an MEng student in MIT's Probabilistic Computing Project. My dorm room last year
		had a gorgeous view of the Charles River and Boston skyline, pictured here--
		can you spot Prudential Tower? This year, I don't have a river view, but my west-facing windows make for gorgeous
		sunsets!<br>
		Outside of classes, I was president of Borderline in 2020 (when I wrote this site lol), and I have
		painted and animated a couple murals on campus. I'm also involved with Women in EECS, and I write and illustrate for
		The Tech (newspaper). In my free time, I like to play badminton, draw, and explore Cambridge/Boston. With my friends Margaret, Audrey, and Penny, I run a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/big_dijkstra_energy/"

		inspired by the
		LoFi radio study girl. </p>
