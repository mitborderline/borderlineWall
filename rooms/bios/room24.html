<p>Hi! I'm Alassia, a Course 16 in the class of '22. I also do NROTC and I am trying to learn Japanese. As efficient as I would want to be during my time at MIT, I can't help but be a big day dreamer. I suppose this room would belong to someone who travels around their world and has a lot to show for their adventures (but who knows what half that stuff is or where they got it from...). That certainly sounds like the ideal to me, but for now I'll just stick with staying at home and feeling lucky that I am afforded the time to make art. I hope you enjoy.</p>
