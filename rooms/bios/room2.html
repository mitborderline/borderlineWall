	<p>Hiii :D My name is Margaret Zheng, I'm one of the current co-prezzes of Borderline :D and I'm c/o 2023 studying course 18 (mathematics) living in McCormick! This room was entirely made-up, but it does preserve some of my favorite memories during my first-year at MIT - jamming on musical instruments, hanging out with friends, putting sticky notes all over the walls of my dorm room, painting murals, working out... and as a result, as you can see, there is no bed - because, you know, not too much time for sleep :P (jk, lol, I'd love myself some sleep!) Other than schoolwork and Borderline, I'm on RingComm 2023, McCormick's house government, and sometimes I doodle @big_dijkstra_energy on instagram along w/ my amazing friends Gloria, Audrey, and Penny! I'll always be excited to meet new friends :DD
