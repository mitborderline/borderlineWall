 <p>Hi, I'm Jocelyn Shen, and I'm a junior majoring in course 6-3 and minoring in 14. This was my room in McCormick 7W last year, where I would enjoy the sunset with friends and drink tea (friends not depicted because...social distancing?). On campus, I was a part of SWE (Society of Women Engineers) exec board, and I UROPed in the Media Lab's Personal Robotics group, which is where I'll be doing graduate school next year! Aside from that, in my free time I like to <a href="http://jocelynshen.com/#artwork" target="js_">write and draw</a>! Looking forward to meeting everyone soon :) </p>
